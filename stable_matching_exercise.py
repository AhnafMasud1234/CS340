# Stable Matching Problem: Implement the Gale-Shapley Algorithm

"""
Background:
You are given two groups: a set of men and a set of women. Each person has ranked all members of the opposite group in order of preference. 
Your task is to implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm to produce a stable matching between the two groups.

Instructions:
1. Create preference lists for a set of 4 men and 4 women.
2. Implement the Gale-Shapley algorithm where men propose to women.
3. Output the final stable matching.
4. Ensure the result is stable by checking that no unmatched man and woman pair prefer each other over their current matches.

Bonus:
- Add an option to switch proposers (i.e., let women propose instead).
- Compare the resulting matchings.

This exercise is expected to take about 1 hour.
